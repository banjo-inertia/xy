==========
Dogfood minimal functionality with new API

This development release is so I can start dogfooding this module. The
module is now packaged and released using conda. The intialization
signature for a `Datac` object has been changed to be more pythonic (I
hope). `Datac` objects behave like lists. Finally, `Datac` modules can
serialize themselves as YAML and also feature a `save` method.
